                They have signed an open letter warning of protential risks, and say the race to develop AI systems is out of control.<br><br>
                Twitter chief Elon musk is among those who want training of AIs above a certain capacity to be haled for at least six months.<br>
                <br>Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak adn some researchers at Deepmind also signed.<br> OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT,
                recently released GPT-4 - a state of the art technology, which has impressed observers with its ability to do taks such aas
                answering questions about objects in images.<br><br>The letter, from Future of life institute and signed by the luminariesm wants
                development to be halted temporarily at that level, warning in their letter of the risks future, more advanced systems might pose.
                <br> AI systems with human competitive intelligence can pose.<br><br>The Future of Life Institute is a not for profit organisation
                which says its mission is to steer transformative technologies away from extreme, large-scale risks and towards benefiting life.

                Mr Musk, owneer of Twitter and chief executive of car company tesla, is listed as an external adviser to the organisation.<br><br>
                Advanced AIs need to be developed with care, the letter says, but instead, recent months have seen AI labs locked in an out of control
                race to develop and deploy ever more powerful digital minds that no one not even their creators can understand, predict, or reliably control.
                <br><br>The letter warns that AIs could flood information channels with misinformation, and replace jobs with automation.<br><br>
                <strong id="highlight">Is the world prepared for the coming AI storm?</strong> <br><br> The letter follows a recent report from investment bank Goldman Sachs
                which said that while AI was likely to increase productivity, millions of jobs could become automated. <br><br>However, other experts told
                the BBC the effect of AI on the labour market was very hard to predict.
